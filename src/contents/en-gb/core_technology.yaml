    para1: Routing sits on top of Crust. It is our overlay networking and routing layer and forms the brain of the SAFE Network. Its purpose is forming a decentralised Internet and the routing information within it.

It is guaranteed that messages can be routed from any part of the network to any other end - as is proven by the Kademlia paper. Routing works purely on the terms of group consensus. We don’t trust a single entity, only a group decision with

    para1: This is one of the executable consumers of Routing and will primarily hold SAFE Network Data.
    para2: "Vaults support multiple data types: Mutable Data and Immutable Data are currently available to developers. The major difference between these two types is the ability to change the data. Both have their own set of properties."
    para5: "Personas in Vaults handle the different aspects of the network. Data Managers store the data, Client Managers store the users accounts balance, which is currently measured in allowed mutations, and eventually will be changed to Safecoin. Client Managers also store lists of users’ apps and implement the access control rules. There is no requirement to have a registered account to retrieve data and users are always free to send direct read requests to Data Managers."
